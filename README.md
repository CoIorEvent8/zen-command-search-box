# Centered Command Search

This extension updates the theme for the search bar by limiting search suggestions to five, adding a subtle border, and centering the search box.

[OPTIONAL]
Due to some limitations, I could not make the command bar open in the same page as the previous tab. For organization reasons, I recommended my firefox extension: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/only-one-tab/

- It ensures that only one "new tab" page is open at a time.
- It has a "alt + w" keybind to close other tabs (that are not pinned/essential)
